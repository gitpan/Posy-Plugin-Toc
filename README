==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::Toc - Posy plugin create a table of contents.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.52'' of Posy::Plugin::Toc.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

Creates a table of contents generated from headings.

The table of contents will be generated only if the entry contains the
'toc_split' or the 'toc_split_after' values, and only from headers below the
match.

If there are no headers (element $toc_chapter_element), then no table of
contents will be generated.

This creates a 'make_toc' entry action, which should be placed after
'parse_entry' and before 'render_entry' in the entry_action list. If you are
using the Posy::Plugin::ShortBody plugin, this should be placed after
'short_body' in the entry_action list, not before it.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the
config directory.

``toc_split''
String which will be replaced by the table of contents. (default: <!-- toc
-->)

``toc_split_after''
If this is defined, then the table of contents will be placed after the
first match of this string. This is useful for putting a ToC after the first
<h1> header in a file, for example. This overrides toc_split if it is
defined. (default: nothing)

``toc_chapter_element''
Which element marks the header of the "chapters"? (default: h3)

``toc_chapter_prefix''
This will prefix the chapters' headers.

``toc_anchor''
Contents of the anchor of chapters prefix.

``toc_prefix''
Prefix of the table of contents. (default: <h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul
class="PageTOC">)

``toc_line_prefix''
Prefix of the line for each chapter will be inserted into the TOC (default:
<li>)

``toc_line_suffix''
Suffix of the line for each chapter will be inserted into the TOC (default:
</li>)

``toc_suffix''
Suffix of the table of contents. (default: </ul>)


==== INSTALLATION ====

Installation needs will vary depending on the particular setup a person has.


==   Administrator, Automatic   ==

If you are the administrator of the system, then the dead simple method of
installing the modules is to use the CPAN or CPANPLUS system.

    cpanp -i Posy::Plugin::Toc

This will install this plugin in the usual places where modules get
installed when one is using CPAN(PLUS).


==   Administrator, By Hand   ==

If you are the administrator of the system, but don't wish to use the
CPAN(PLUS) method, then this is for you. Take the *.tar.gz file and untar it
in a suitable directory.

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install


==   User With Shell Access   ==

If you are a user on a system, and don't have root/administrator access, you
need to install Posy somewhere other than the default place (since you don't
have access to it). However, if you have shell access to the system, then
you can install it in your home directory.

Say your home directory is "/home/fred", and you want to install the modules
into a subdirectory called "perl".

Download the *.tar.gz file and untar it in a suitable directory.

    perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules, and the PATH variable to find the scripts (posy_one,
posy_static).

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
